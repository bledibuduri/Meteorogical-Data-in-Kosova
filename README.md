## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Meteorological Data in Kosovo" project. This research project focuses on predicting key meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure) for the year 2023, based on datasets collected from 2017 to 2022. The analysis includes correlation studies and visualizations, with the results of the SARIMA algorithm used for forecasting visualized as well.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Source:** The datasets used in this project cover meteorological data in Kosovo from 2017 to 2022.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Exploration and analysis of correlation patterns within the collected data.
- **SARIMA Algorithm:** Utilization of the SARIMA algorithm for predicting meteorological parameters for the year 2023.
- **Visualization:** Presentation of both correlation analysis results and visualizations of SARIMA predictions.

## Project Details
- **Development Environment:** PyCharm
- **Academic Context:** This project is part of university studies, involving real-world data and contributing to research efforts.
